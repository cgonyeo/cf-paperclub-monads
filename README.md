# CloudFlare Paper Club Presentation on Monads

For the Paper Club at CloudFlare I'm giving a talk on [Monads for functional
programming](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf)
by Philip Wadler from the University of Glasgow. This repository contains the
examples to be used in the presentation and the source for the slides.
